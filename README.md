# Ada Constraint_Error Example

This repository demonstrates a common runtime error in Ada: the `Constraint_Error` that occurs when attempting to access an element in an array using an index that is outside of the array's defined bounds.

The `bug.ada` file contains code that intentionally causes this error. The `bugSolution.ada` file shows how to prevent this error using Ada's exception handling mechanism.
